- To dos by developers:

* Fix so that only the first run of step_8 runs for temporary fluctuation
* add rmsd calculation from cryo_fit2 to cryo_fit1
* update add_prefix_chain so that it adds alphabetically
* I'd better use rigid-body translation/rotation from dock_in_map to solve too low initial cc issue.
* Use part of modules of dock_in_map for very_low_initial_cc_issue
* Apply MD force to loops only
* Update phi/psi

* Allow to calculate electrostatic interaction as well
* Update cryo_fit so that cryo_fit.overall_log is updated in real time
* Allow cryo_fit to work with map coefficent (mtz file) as well
* Add more amber03 forcefield parameters for DDB and ribosome
